# PentaProsthetics
This is currently a work in progress. 
When the website is completed it will become the official site for the non for profit, Penta Prosthetics.
Penta Prosthetics is a corporation that repurposes used prosthetics in the United States and donates them to amputees in Vietnam and other developing countries.
